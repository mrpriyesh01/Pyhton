QUESTION=Python has built-in string validation methods for basic data.
It can check if a string is composed of alphabetical characters, alphanumeric characters, digits, etc.


CODE=

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input()  # Prompt user for input and store it in 's'
    
    # Initialize flags to False
    alnum = False  # Flag for alphanumeric characters
    alph = False   # Flag for alphabetical characters
    digi = False   # Flag for digits
    lw = False     # Flag for lowercase letters
    up = False     # Flag for uppercase letters
    
    # Loop through each character in the string 's'
    for c in s:
        if c.isalnum():
            alnum = True      # Set 'alnum' to True if any character is alphanumeric
        if c.isalpha():
            alph = True       # Set 'alph' to True if any character is alphabetical
        if c.isdigit():
            digi = True       # Set 'digi' to True if any character is a digit
        if c.islower():
            lw = True          # Set 'lw' to True if any character is lowercase
        if c.isupper():
            up = True         # Set 'up' to True if any character IS UPPER
